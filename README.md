# Introduction 
Ready to use implementation of Azure Redis Cache in Azure function with NET 6. 

Azure Cache for Redis provides an in-memory data store based on the Redis software. Redis improves the performance and scalability of an application that uses backend data stores heavily. It's able to process large volumes of application requests by keeping frequently accessed data in the server memory, which can be written to and read from quickly. Redis brings a critical low-latency and high-throughput data storage solution to modern applications.

This repo demostrate how to communicate with Azure Redis using one of the most popular library available (StackEnchange.Redis). This uses .NET 6.
